# temporal-alignment-dtw

The temporal alignment system uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to synchronize foreground and background videos with different timings and frame rates.

## Core Business Logic

### DTW Frame Alignment
- Creates frame-to-frame mapping between foreground and background videos
- Constructs cost matrix representing similarity between all possible frame pairs 
- Applies monotonicity constraint to prevent backwards time jumps
- Uses Sakoe-Chiba band windowing to constrain warping path
- Generates continuous alignment map through interpolation between key frames

### Frame Fingerprinting
- Standardizes frames to uniform size/grayscale for comparison
- Implements multi-algorithm perceptual hashing:
  - pHash (DCT frequency analysis)
  - AverageHash (mean color values)
  - ColorMomentHash (color distribution) 
  - MarrHildrethHash (edge detection)
- Combines hashes with color histograms into unified fingerprint

### Temporal Synchronization Flow
1. Sample frames from both videos at varying densities
2. Generate fingerprints for sampled frames
3. Build frame similarity cost matrix
4. Find optimal DTW path through cost matrix
5. Interpolate full frame mapping from sparse matches

### Drift Prevention 
- Adaptive keyframe sampling based on FPS differences
- Maintains consistent sync without accumulating temporal drift
- Preserves foreground timing while warping background

### Video Composition
- Uses frame mapping to fetch correct background frames
- Ensures sequential frame reading for performance
- Maintains perfect frame-level synchronization
